## Requirements

The only hard dependencies are Java 8 or above (9 preferred) and Maven 3 or above.  You can read Ignite's [Cluster Configuration](https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/cluster-config) documentation to see how to set up a production cluster, otherwise you can use the default configuration of a local cluster on a single machine.

You should be running the Java Virtual Machine with at least 256Mb of memory though you'll typically want to use up to 31Gb per machine in the cluster.
